# CreatureGame
*A game about breeding creatures based on traits.*

**Here are the rules:**

You breed creatures. It costs money to breed them. You start with $2000 and it costs the average of the prices of each creature. Each creature gets its price from the sum of all of its stats. At this point that's all stats do, but more will be added soon.

Each creature has two types of traits. Random stats and genes. Random stats are generated randomly and at this moment there is no way you can influence them. Genetic stats are what stats each creature inherits from its parents, taking a random gene from each parent. Stats influence the price of the creature. If you breed creatures with optimal stats, they can sell for more.

The way each creature looks is reflective of its traits. Some traits are dominant but others are recessive. Additionally, each creature has a color, which it inherits from its parents. Each creature's colors is the average of it's parents colors, plus or minus 100.

You breed creatures by selecting a creature, pressing the breed button, and selecting another creature of a diferent gender. Then you are taken to a breed screen, where you can look at the values of each creature and see if you want to breed them together. If you do, it will cost money but you will have a new creature.

Technecally, the number of possible creatures is (2^7)\*(255^3). However, the number that you will actually see is much lower. More traits may be added, but for now it's a simple game.

The goal of the game is to make as much money as possible, by clever breeding and luck. You should do that. Now play the game.



**Have fun and good luck.**
